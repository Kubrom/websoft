            <p>
              I have never created websites before. I always wanted to learn how
              to create good websites sadly, I never had the time.

              So far i have worked with developing android mobile applications
              and desktop application using java. WE did not have in our
              programme "software development", courses related to web
              applications. As such my experience and knowledge with web
              development is very low. I am very exicted to have this course.
              With this course I believe I will gain the basic knowledge needed
              to make a good dynamic website.

              HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and
              modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. CSS is
              used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. JavaScript
              is used to control the behavior of different elements.

            <p>
              The browser send an http request to the web server asking for a
              file or a page, If the server has the requested data it sends it
              to the browser with the a successfull message(200) and closes the
              connection. If the server does not have have the data it sends an
              error message to the browser(404) and closes the connection.

            In this programme that is software development for the web, we have
            learnt java. On my own I have learnt a little bit of C languange and
            Arduino. When it comes to naming conventions javascript is similar
            to java. When it comes to syntax javascript is more similar to C
            language. However when it comes to declaring variables, javascript
            is very different as it is loosely typed language.

            I aim for grade 5. out of all tasks i found challenging fetching
            data from a json object and displaying it to a table, however after
            long hours of stackoverflow search and youtube videos I managed to
            solve it. Hence I completed all the tasks for grade 3, grade 4 and
            grade 5.

            I found it very intersting to work with Node. The idea to run your
            javascript code out of a browser is very interesting. Tring to
            implement functionalities with pure Node could become complicated at
            times and might distract you from your actual bussiness logic of
            your application. Having a framework such us Express is very
            helpfull and time saving, this way you can spend your time more on
            functionalities that are directly related to the bussiness logic of
            your application.

          <p>
            In the beginning since I was new to the world of Node, it took me a
            lot of time just to understand the basics, infact I bought a couple
            of videos from udemy and watched a series of tutorias on a youtube
            channel called Net ninja.

          </p>
          <p>Its  a very good multi purpose programming language. With PHP we can handle a
          lot of tasks and can make very good interactive/dynamic websites. We can 
          use php to create, update, delete and read files on servers and databases.
          If we want convert important data on our files to Excel or PDF files 
          for easier analysis, PHP can pull the data and present it in both forms 
          automatically so we won’t need to do any manual conversion.
          My general feeling about PHP is that even though it can be used for 
          complex code, it is easy to learn</p>

            <strong>Can you compare PHP to other languages you know?</strong>
