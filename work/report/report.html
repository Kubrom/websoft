<h2>S01</h2>
<p><strong>Did you before know about the techniques Git, GitHub, Markdown and/or GitHub Pages?</strong></p>
    <p> <p> <strong>Answer:</strong>
        I used git hub before, however i did not know about Markdown or GitHub Pages.</p>
    
        <p><strong> Have you ever created websites before?</strong></p>
        <p> <strong>Answer:</strong>
        I have never created websites before. I always wanted to learn how to create good websites
        sadly, I never had the time. </p>
    
        <p><strong>Briefly explain your experience and knowledge of web application development.</strong>    </p>
        <p> <strong>Answer:</strong>
        So far i have worked with developing android mobile applications 
        and desktop application using java.
        WE did not have in  our programme "software development", courses related
        to web applications. As such my experience and knowledge with web development
        is very low. I am very exicted to have this course. With this course I
        believe I will gain  the basic knowledge  needed to make a good dynamic
        website.   </p>
    
        <p><strong>What is your TIL for this course section</strong>   </p>
        <p> <strong>Answer:</strong>
        In this course section i have learned about forking. It is the first time I have used
        the fork tool.
        I have learnt how to uptade a forked repo.
        I have learnt how to set up Git pages.
        I have leant to use Visual studio.
        I have learnt to create links in html.  </p>
