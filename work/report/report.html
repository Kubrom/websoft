        <p>

        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> So far i have worked with developing android
          mobile applications and desktop application using java. WE did not
          have in our programme "software development", courses related to web
          applications. As such my experience and knowledge with web development
          is very low. I am very exicted to have this course. With this course I
          believe I will gain the basic knowledge needed to make a good dynamic
          website.

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong> HTML provides the basic structure of sites,
          which is enhanced and modified by other technologies like CSS and
          JavaScript. CSS is used to control presentation, formatting, and
          layout. JavaScript is used to control the behavior of different
          elements.

          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer: </strong>The browser send an http request to the web
          server asking for a file or a page, If the server has the requested
          data it sends it to the browser with the a successfull message(200)
          and closes the connection. If the server does not have have the data
          it sends an error message to the browser(404) and closes the
          connection.
