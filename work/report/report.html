              So far i have worked with developing android mobile applications
              and desktop application using java. WE did not have in our
              programme "software development", courses related to web
              applications. As such my experience and knowledge with web
              development is very low. I am very exicted to have this course.
              With this course I believe I will gain the basic knowledge needed
              to make a good dynamic website.

              HTML provides the basic structure of sites, which is enhanced and
              modified by other technologies like CSS and JavaScript. CSS is
              used to control presentation, formatting, and layout. JavaScript
              is used to control the behavior of different elements.

              The browser send an http request to the web server asking for a
              file or a page, If the server has the requested data it sends it
              to the browser with the a successfull message(200) and closes the
              connection. If the server does not have have the data it sends an
              error message to the browser(404) and closes the connection.

            In this programme that is software development for the web, we have
            learnt java. On my own I have learnt a little bit of C languange and
            Arduino. When it comes to naming conventions javascript is similar
            to java. When it comes to syntax javascript is more similar to C
            language. However when it comes to declaring variables, javascript
            is very different as it is loosely typed language.

            I found it very intersting to work with Node. The idea to run your

            implement functionalities with pure Node could become complicated at
            times and might distract you from your actual bussiness logic of
            your application. Having a framework such us Express is very
            helpfull and time saving, this way you can spend your time more on
            functionalities that are directly related to the bussiness logic of
            your application.

            In the beginning since I was new to the world of Node, it took me a

            Its a very good multi purpose programming language. With PHP we can
            handle a lot of tasks and can make very good interactive/dynamic
            websites. We can use php to create, update, delete and read files on
            servers and databases. If we want convert important data on our
            files to Excel or PDF files for easier analysis, PHP can pull the
            data and present it in both forms automatically so we won’t need to
            do any manual conversion. My general feeling about PHP is that even
            though it can be used for complex code, it is easy to learn!

            My opinion on popularity of programming languages is that is
            directly related with the corporate world. A language could be easy
            to learn, have many libraries but if it is not backed or used by
            companies, it want last long in short there must be a huge market
            opportunity. In my view Java and PHP will continue to rise as they
            are hot in the corporate world. Many organizations use Spring(Java)
            and Codeigniter(PHP) as their backend frameworkk. R and MATLAB are
            also gone remain popular in the Data Analitics world. C/C++ and
            Golang are gone remain the top choices in building low-latency and
            scalable systems. Phyton and JavaScript are gone remain hot in the
            startup world, as many startups use Django(Phyton), Flask(Phyton),
            and NodeJS(JavaScript) as their backend frameworks.

            I have two choices one is Javascript the other is Phyton. If we are
            intersted in building real-time applications I would choose
            javascript beacuse of its performance speed compared to Phyton. When
            it comes to Data Science I would go for Phyton. In genreal if it was
            not for performance speed I would have choosen Phyton because of its
            simplicity.

            represents Django framework.
            As it can been seen by the graph till 2013 Django was more popular.
            After 2013 however the popularity for Node.js took over Django.
            It is important to mention that Django framework was created in the fall of 2003
            and Node.js in May of 2009.
            This graphs starts comparing both frameworks worldwide trends from 2009.

          <p>C# is a general-purpose, modern and object-oriented programming language

            European Computer 
            Manufacturers Association (ECMA) and International Standards Organization (ISO).
            C# is a lot similar to Java syntactically and is easy for the users who have 
            knowledge of C, C++ or Java.
            C# has manyreasons for being popular and in demand. Its easy to start, 
             its widely used for developing Desktop and Web Application, it has a huge community and its 
            used in game development. In short C# is like Java, which you can use to develop multiple
            differnt type of applications.

            ASP. NET is a server side web technology, like PHP or JSP. C# is used when 
            developing ASP.net.<br>
            .NET is a developer platform made up of tools, programming languages, 
            and libraries for building many different types of applications.ASP.NET extends 
            the .NET developer platform with tools and libraries specifically for 
            building web apps.

          <p> 
            PHP is a programming language whereas ASP.NET is a programming framework. Websites developed by ASP.NET may use C#, but also other languages such as J#.

ASP.NET is compiled whereas PHP is interpreted. This means that ASP.NET websites generally have shorter execution times, but also that changing the website becomes more complicated as it needs to be re-compiled (whereas for PHP websites you can simply replace the new code). The decrease of execution time is, however, seldom noticable. This is because most of the page rendering times arises from setting up the connection and querying databases.

Visual Studio provides numerous "shortcuts" to facilitate programming in ASP.NET. Dealing with action events (e.g. user clicks), forms, databases etc. is relatively straightforward and tends to take less time compared to PHP where everything needs to be literally scripted. This increases the risk of security flaws such as SQL injection. Nevertheless, inexperienced programming is, to my opinion, equally harmful in both environments.

ASP.NET is designed for windows machines, whereas PHP is platform free (and typically runs on Linux servers). Besides the fact that Linux servers are well known for their stability and security, Windows is a licensed platform which implies that hosting an ASP.NET site will usually involve more costs

              >Elaborate on a few (3-5) different security issues or concerns,
              from your own experience, related to web application security and
              relate them to the OWASP top ten.</strong

          </p>
          <p>I am quite new to the web development world hence I dont have much 
            experience related to secutity. Nevertheless from the database course we took
            in the first year one security issue that come to my attention was sql injection (SQLi)
            attacks.
            SQL Injection (SQLi) is a type of an injection attack that makes it possible to execute 
            malicious SQL statements. These statements control a database server behind a web 
            application. Attackers can use SQL Injection vulnerabilities to bypass application 
            security measures.<br> They can go around authentication and authorization of a web page 
            or web application and retrieve the content of the entire SQL database. 
            They can also use SQL Injection to add, modify, and delete records in the database.
            An SQL Injection vulnerability may affect any website or web application that 
            uses an SQL database such as MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, or others. 
            Criminals may use it to gain unauthorized access to your sensitive 
            data: customer information, personal data, trade secrets, intellectual property, 
            and more. SQL Injection attacks are one of the oldest, most prevalent, and most 
            dangerous web application vulnerabilities. 
            The OWASP organization (Open Web Application Security Project) lists injections in their OWASP Top 10  document as the number one threat to web application security.

            <ol>
              <li>Follow the OWASP Top Ten. These security vulnerabilities target the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of an application, its developers, and its users. They cover such attack vectors as injection attacks, 
                authentication and session management, security misconfiguration, and sensitive data exposure.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Get an Application Security Audit. </li>
              <br>
              <li>Implement Proper Logging</li>
              <br>
              <li>Use Real-time Security Monitoring and Protection.</li>
              <br>
              <li>Encrypt Everything</li>
              <br>
              <li>Harden Everything.
                Now that all traffic and data is encrypted, from operating systems to 
                software development frameworks you need to ensure that they’re sufficiently hardened.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>Keep Your Servers Up to Date.
                Make sure that your servers are set to update to the latest security releases as they become available.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>Keep Your Software Up to Date.
                As well as keeping the operating system up to date, you need to keep your application framework and third party libraries up to date as well.
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>Stay Abreast of the Latest Vulnerabilities
                this is strongly tied to the previous point. Given the number of attack vectors in play today, vectors such as Cross-site scripting, code injection, SQL injection, insecure direct object references, and cross-site request forgery 
                it’s hard to both stay abreast of them as well as to know what the new ones are.
              </li>

          <p><strong>What is your TIL for this course section?</strong></p>
          <p>I didn’t know about OWASP top-10 before.It is important to learn how to write 
            an efficient code against 
            these security vulnerabilities.</p>
