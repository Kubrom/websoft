        At the age of 8 I got my first computer, my dad brought an old PC with
        windows 95 from his office. I remember vividly I used to play an old
        version of super Mario.During high school I took a course in technical
        drawing and worked a lot with AUTOCAD. As such I like designing and
        editing.I joined Kristinastad university in 2017 before joining I worked
        in a construction company as surveyor and in an import and export
        company as a sales person.For more inforation about my work experiences

        As a kid I enjoyed watching movies and documentaries, at home with my
        big brother we used to watch national geography and world war 2
        documentaries. Growing up I become more social and my favourite past
        time activities was going to pubs.Currently my hobbies are taking long
        walks into the nature, cooking and travelling.
      </p>

      <p>
        When it comes to sports I used to like playing chess( if you consider
        that as a sport lol) and all kinds of board games. Currently I am
        interested in swimming in genral and diving in particular, I regularly
        swimm twice a week.My plan is to become a good diver. My dream one day
        to buy a house by the sea and a boat.
